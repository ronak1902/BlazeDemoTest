Scenarios to be added

1. Negative scenarios like pressing the submit button without entring all the details
2. Field level validations
3. Other non functional tests like performance and security tests can be added
4. Framework can be extended to support API testing using rest assured framework
5. Various flows like verifying payment details(which are wrong) on purchase page
6. login and logout scenario tests(website is too flaky for that)
7. Adding custom reporting
8. Running the tests through build tools like Jenkins, VSTS etc.

atleast 20 more scenarios can be added for this website and more than 80% will fail because website is too shitty.

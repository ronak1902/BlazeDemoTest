Scenarios to be added

1. Negative scenarios like pressing the submit button without entring all the details
2. Field level validations
3. Other non functional tests like performance and security tests can be added
4. Framework can be extended to support API testing using rest assured framework
5. Various flows like verifying payment details(which are wrong) on purchase page
6. login and logout scenario tests(website is too flaky for that)
7. Adding custom reporting
8. Running the tests through build tools like Jenkins, VSTS etc.

atleast 20 more scenarios can be added for this website and more than 80% will fail because website is too buggy

Space Z Api Tests:

Please not I have added Api tests in the same project as seperate cucumber project file.
Please also go through the scenarios for Api tests as well.

I would like to add more scenarios for Space X as below:

1. Negative scenarios for fields
2. JMeter performance tests-to check load testing of API
3. more scenarios around 'cores' to verify land pad and more details
4. try to add image verification tests.
5. integrate visiting reddit website with UI tests for validations
6. all image link verifications
7. more funactional tests around update of the Space X details, etc
